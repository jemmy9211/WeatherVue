# WeatherVue

## Introduction

WeatherVue is a web application that integrates with the public API provided by the Central Weather Bureau of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Utilizing the data offered by this API, the application employs advanced visualization techniques to enhance the accessibility of complex weather data for users. The project leverages Vue, Bootstrap, and Leaflet technologies, facilitating the rapid and practical development of the web interface.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Access current information from weather observation stations across Taiwan including temperature, wind speed, and forecasts
- **Station Positioning**: Precise location data for all observation stations
- **Interactive Map**: Explore weather observation stations throughout Taiwan with an interactive map interface
- **Station Details**: Click on map markers to view detailed information about each observation station
- **Search Functionality**: Find observation stations by name or location
- **Radar Echo Map**: Visualize precipitation patterns across regions

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js 3**: Frontend framework with Composition API
- **Vue Router**: For application routing
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI component library and responsive design
- **Leaflet**: Interactive mapping library
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API requests
